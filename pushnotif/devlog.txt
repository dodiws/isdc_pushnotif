NOTE:
- On simple cache system
  Objective: prevent repeated request of the exact same resource
  Implemented using dict
  Syntax [deprecated; reason: bug when cacheid is in cache but cache['cacheid'] is None]:
    result = cache[cacheid] = cache.get(cacheid) or long_running_function()
  Syntax:
    result = cache[cacheid] = cache[cacheid] if (cacheid in cache) else long_running_function()
    or
    result = cache.setdefault(cacheid, (cacheid in cache) or long_running_function())
    or (not tested)
    result = cacheget(cacheid, long_running_function, *args, **kwargs)
  result will be retrieved from cache dict based on unique cacheid, long_running_function() executed only when cacheid not in cache
- when replacing create_earthquake.json insert $event_code template variable
  on appropiate places
- Run pushnotif as celery task including other tasks listed in CELERY_IMPORTS in settings.py:
  ./manage.py celery worker
  or
  celery -A geonode.celery_app worker --loglevel=DEBUG
